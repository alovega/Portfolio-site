        <p>Apart from being a software developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. During the warmer months here, I enjoy mountain cycling, tried rock/wall climbing, and kayaking.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend large amount of my free time exploring and learning  the latest technology advancements in the web development world.</p>
